# During this DevOps project, we are going to deploy our application on three different kind of target environment:
## 1. Tomcat Server
## 2. Docker Container
## 3. Kubernetes

                                # DevOps Project â€” CI/CD -1

###### Project ToolBox ðŸ§°
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Git will be used to manage our application source code.
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Jenkins is an open source automation CI tool which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) Maven will be used for the application packaging and building including running unit test cases
- [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/introduction.html)) Apache Tomcat, is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is one of the most widely used application servers for deploying and running Java-based web applications, particularly Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)cases.

For this, we are going to set up CI/CD pipeline with the help of GitHub Jenkins Maven, and Tomcat.

## Setup CI/CD with Github, Jenkins, Maven and Tomcat
1) Setup Jenkins
2) Setup and configure Maven and Git
3) Setup Tomcat Server
4) Integrate Github, Maven, Tomcat Server with Jenkins
5) Create CI/CD job
6) Test the deployment
