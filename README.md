# DevOps-Project--CICD-1
## During this DevOps project, we are going to deploy our application on three different kinds of target environments:
- [Tomcat Server](https://tomcat.apache.org/) Tomcat is a widely used server for hosting Java-based web applications due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robustness. It plays a significant role in the Java web development ecosystem.
- [Docker Container](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in lightweight, isolated environments called containers. Containers provide a consistent and reproducible environment for applications to run, ensuring that an application and all its dependencies can work reliably across different environments, from development to production.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/#why-you-need-kubernetes-and-what-can-it-do) Kubernetes abstracts away many of the complexities involved in managing containerized applications at scale. It enables efficient resource utilization, automatic scaling, rolling updates, self-healing, and service discovery. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in cloud-native application development, making it easier to deploy and manage complex microservices architectures and applications in production environments.

## We are going to set up CI/CD pipeline with the help of GitHub Jenkins Maven, and Tomcat.

## Setup CI/CD with Github, Jenkins, Maven and Tomcat
1) Setup Jenkins
2) Setup and configure Maven and Git
3) Setup Tomcat Server
4) Integrate Github, Maven, Tomcat Server with Jenkins
5) Create CI/CD job
6) Test the deployment
